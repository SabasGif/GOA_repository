        <p>Boxing[b] is a combat sport and martial art.[1] Taking place in a boxing ring, it involves two people – usually wearing protective
             equipment, such as protective gloves, hand wraps, and mouthguards – throwing punches at each other for a predetermined amount of 
             time.</p>

            <i>Although the term "boxing" is commonly attributed to western boxing, in which only fists are involved, it has developed in different ways in different geographical areas and cultures of the World. In global terms, "boxing" today is also a set of combat sports focused on striking, in which two opponents face each other in a fight using at least their fists, and possibly involving other actions, such as kicks, elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules. Some of these variants are the bare-knuckle boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Lethwei, savate, and sanda.[2][3] Boxing techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts, military systems, and other combat sports.</i>
            <p>Humans have engaged in hand-to-hand combat since the earliest days of human history. The origins of boxing in any of its forms as a sport remain uncertain,[4] but some sources suggest that it has prehistoric roots in what is now Ethiopia, emerging as early as the sixth millennium BC. It is believed that when the Egyptians invaded Nubia, they adopted boxing from the local populace, subsequently popularizing it in Egypt. From there, the sport of boxing spread to various regions, including Greece, eastward to Mesopotamia, and northward to Rome.[5]</p>
            <p>The earliest visual evidence of any type of boxing is from Egypt and Sumer, both from the third millennia,[6] and can be seen in Sumerian carvings from the third and second millennia BC.[7][8][9][10] The earliest evidence of boxing rules dates back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC.[7] Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules.</p>
            <p>Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games – it also has its world championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee[11] over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called "rounds"</p>
            <p>A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualifies an opponent, or the opponent resigns. When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor. In case both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, a professional bout is considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria.</p>

                Hitting with different extremities of the body, such as kicks and punches, as an act of human aggression, has existed across the world throughout human history, being a combat system as old as wrestling. However, in terms of sports competition, due to the lack of writing in the prehistoric times and the lack of references, it is not possible to determine rules of any kind of boxing in prehistory, and in ancient times only can be inferred from the few intact sources and references to the sport.</p>
                <i>he origin of the sport of boxing is unknown,[4] however according to some sources boxing in any of its forms has prehistoric origins in present-day Ethiopia, where it appeared in the sixth millennium BC. When the Egyptians invaded Nubia they learned the art of boxing from the local population, and they took the sport to Egypt where it became popular. From Egypt, boxing spread to other countries including Greece, eastward to Mesopotamia, and northward to Rome.[5]</i>
                <p>he earliest visual evidence of any type of boxing comes from Egypt and Sumer both from the third millennium BC.[6][7] A relief sculpture from Egyptian Thebes (c. 1350 BC) shows both boxers and spectators.[7] These early Middle-Eastern and Egyptian depictions showed contests where fighters were either bare-fisted or had a band supporting the wrist.[7] The earliest evidence of use of gloves can be found in Minoan Crete (c. 1500–1400 BC).[7]</p>

                   <p>Various types of boxing existed in ancient India. The earliest references to musti-yuddha come from classical Vedic epics such as the Rig Veda (c. 1500–1000 BCE) and Ramayana (c. 700–400 BCE).[12] The Mahabharata describes two combatants boxing with clenched fists and fighting with kicks, finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts during the time of King Virata.[13] Duels (niyuddham) were often fought to the death. During the period of the Western Satraps, the ruler Rudradaman – in addition to being well-versed in "the great sciences" which included Indian classical music, Sanskrit grammar, and logic – was said to be an excellent horseman, charioteer, elephant rider, swordsman and boxer.[14] The Gurbilas Shemi, an 18th-century Sikh text, gives numerous references to musti-yuddha. The martial art is related to other forms of martial arts found in other parts of the Indian cultural sphere including Muay Thai in Thailand, Muay Lao in Laos, Pradal Serey in Cambodia and Lethwei in Myanmar.[15][16]</p>
                   <p>In Ancient Greece boxing was a well developed sport called pygmachia, and enjoyed consistent popularity. In Olympic terms, it was first introduced in the 23rd Olympiad, 688 BC. The boxers would wind leather thongs around their hands in order to protect them. There were no rounds and boxers fought until one of them acknowledged defeat or could not continue. Weight categories were not used, which meant heavier fighters had a tendency to dominate. The style of boxing practiced typically featured an advanced left leg stance, with the left arm semi-extended as a guard, in addition to being used for striking, and with the right arm drawn back ready to strike. It was the head of the opponent which was primarily targeted, and there is little evidence to suggest that targeting the body or the use of kicks was common,[17][18] in which it resembled modern western boxing.</p>
                   <p>Boxing was a popular spectator sport in Ancient Rome.[19] Fighters protected their knuckles with leather strips wrapped around their fists. Eventually harder leather was used and the strips became a weapon. Metal studs were introduced to the strips to make the cestus. Fighting events were held at Roman amphitheatres.</p>

                   <h1>Early London prize ring rules</h1>
                   <p>Records of boxing activity disappeared in the west after the fall of the Western Roman Empire when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned. However, there are detailed records of various fist-fighting sports that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport in ancient Rus called kulachniy boy or 'fist fighting'.[20]</p>
                   <i>As the wearing of swords became less common, there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists. The sport later resurfaced in England during the early 16th century in the form of bare-knuckle boxing, sometimes referred to as prizefighting. The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the London Protestant Mercury, and the first English bare-knuckle champion was James Figg in 1719.[21] This is also the time when the word "boxing" first came to be used. This earliest form of modern boxing was very different. Contests in Mr. Figg's time, in addition to fist fighting, also contained fencing and cudgeling. On 6 January 1681, the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle (and later Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica), engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize.</i>
                   <p>Early fighting had no written rules. There were no weight divisions or round limits, and no referee. In general, it was extremely chaotic. An early article on boxing was published in Nottingham in 1713, by Sir Thomas Parkyns, 2nd Baronet, a wrestling patron from Bunny, Nottinghamshire, who had practised the techniques he described. The article, a single page in his manual of wrestling and fencing, Progymnasmata: The inn-play, or Cornish-hugg wrestler, described a system of headbutting, punching, eye-gouging, chokes, and hard throws, not recognized in boxing today.[22]</p>

                   <p>The first boxing rules, called the Broughton Rules, were introduced by champion Jack Broughton in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred.[23] Under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton encouraged the use of "mufflers", a form of padded bandage or mitten, to be used in "jousting" or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.</p>
                   <p>These rules did allow the fighters an advantage not enjoyed by today's boxers; they permitted the fighter to drop to one knee to end the round and begin the 30-second count at any time. Thus a fighter realizing he was in trouble had an opportunity to recover. However, this was considered "unmanly"[24] and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the seconds of the boxers.[25] In modern boxing, there is a three-minute limit to rounds (unlike the downed fighter ends the round rule). Intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system. Furthermore, as the contestants did not have heavy leather gloves and wristwraps to protect their hands, they used different punching technique to preserve their hands because the head was a common target to hit full out.[dubious – discuss][citation needed] Almost all period manuals have powerful straight punches with the whole body behind them to the face (including forehead) as the basic blows.[26][27][unreliable source?]</p>
                   <p>The British sportswriter Pierce Egan coined the term "the sweet science" as an epithet for prizefighting – or more fully "the sweet science of bruising" as a description of England's bare-knuckle fight scene in the early nineteenth century.[28]

Boxing could also be used to settle disputes even by females. In 1790 in Waddington, Lincolnshire Mary Farmery and Susanna Locker both laid claim to the affections of a young man; this produced a challenge from the former to fight for the prize, which was accepted by the latter. Proper sidesmen were chosen, and every matter conducted in form. After several knock-down blows on both sides, the battle ended in favour of Mary Farmery.[29]

The London Prize Ring Rules introduced measures that remain in effect for professional boxing to this day, such as outlawing butting, gouging, scratching, kicking, hitting a man while down, holding the ropes, and using resin, stones or hard objects in the hands, and biting.[30]</p>

<h1>Marquess of Queensberry rules (1867)</h1>
<br><br>
<p>In 1867, the Marquess of Queensberry rules were drafted by John Chambers for amateur championships held at Lillie Bridge in London for lightweights, middleweights and heavyweights. The rules were published under the patronage of the Marquess of Queensberry, whose name has always been associated with them.

There were twelve rules in all, and they specified that fights should be "a fair stand-up boxing match" in a 24-foot-square or similar ring. Rounds were three minutes with one-minute rest intervals between rounds. Each fighter was given a ten-second count if he was knocked down, and wrestling was banned. The introduction of gloves of "fair-size" also changed the nature of the bouts. An average pair of boxing gloves resembles a bloated pair of mittens and are laced up around the wrists.[32]

The gloves can be used to block an opponent's blows. As a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. Because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face.

Late 19th and early 20th centuries
Through the late 19th century, the martial art of boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy. Outlawed in England and much of the United States, prizefights were often held at gambling venues and broken up by police.[33] Brawling and wrestling tactics continued, and riots at prizefights were common occurrences. Still, throughout this period, there arose some notable bare knuckle champions who developed fairly sophisticated fighting tactics.


Amateur Boxing Club, Wales, 1963
The English case of R v. Coney in 1882 found that a bare-knuckle fight was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, despite the consent of the participants. This marked the end of widespread public bare-knuckle contests in England.

The first world heavyweight champion under the Queensberry Rules was "Gentleman Jim" Corbett, who defeated John L. Sullivan in 1892 at the Pelican Athletic Club in New Orleans.[34]

The first instance of film censorship in the United States occurred in 1897 when several states banned the showing of prize fighting films from the state of Nevada,[35] where it was legal at the time.

Throughout the early 20th century, boxers struggled to achieve legitimacy.[36] They were aided by the influence of promoters like Tex Rickard and the popularity of great champions such as John L. Sullivan.</p>

<h1>Modern boxing</h1>
<br>
<p>The modern sport arose from illegal venues and outlawed prizefighting and has become a multibillion-dollar commercial enterprise. A majority of young talent still comes from poverty-stricken areas around the world.[37] Places like Mexico, Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe prove to be filled with young aspiring athletes who wish to become the future of boxing. Even in the U.S., places like the inner cities of New York, and Chicago have given rise to promising young talent. According to Rubin, "boxing lost its appeal with the American middle class, and most of who boxes in modern America come from the streets and are street fighters".[38]</p>
<h1>Rules</h1>
<br>
<i>ain article: Marquess of Queensberry Rules
The Marquess of Queensberry Rules have been the general rules governing modern boxing since their publication in 1867.[32]

A boxing match typically consists of a determined number of three-minute rounds, a total of up to 9 to 12 rounds with a minute spent between each round with the fighters resting in their assigned corners and receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls.

Up to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches and elbows that connect, defense, knockdowns, hugging and other, more subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one or both fighters believe they have been "robbed" or unfairly denied a victory. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where their coach, as well as one or more "seconds" may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signalled end of each round.

A bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges, and is said to "go the distance". The fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. With three judges, unanimous and split decisions are possible, as are draws. A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knock-out; such bouts are said to have ended "inside the distance". If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent's punch and not a slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to their feet and can continue. Some jurisdictions require the referee to count to eight regardless of if the fighter gets up before.

Should the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled "knocked out" (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by knockout (KO). A "technical knock-out" (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a "three-knockdown rule", in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. A "standing eight" count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that the referee feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. After counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if the fighter is fit to continue. For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown.</i>
<p>n general, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting. The boxer's shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury. Failure to abide by the former may result in a foul. They also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from hitting the back, back of the head or neck (called a "rabbit-punch") or the kidneys. They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between).</p>

მოთამაშეთა რაოდენობა ყოველ გუნდში 5-5 კაცით განისაზღვრება. თამაშის დროს ჩაგდებული ბურთისათვის გუნდს ერიცხება 2 ან 3 ქულა, ყოველი რეალიზებული საჯარიმო ტყორცნისათვის 1 ქულა, გამარჯვებულია ის გუნდი, რომელიც მეტ ქულას დააგროვებს. შეხვედრა შედგება ოთხი 10-წუთიანი (სუფთა დრო) მეოთხედისგან. მეოთხედებს შორის შესვენება 2 წუთია. გამონაკლისია შესვენება მეორე და მესამე მეოთხედებს შორის, რომელიც 15 წუთი გრძელდება. მატჩის ფრედ დამთვრების შემთხვევაში ინიშნება დამატებითი 5-წუთიანი ტაიმი (ან ტაიმები), გამარჯვებულის გამოვლენამდე. დაშვებულია ნებისმიერი რაოდენობის შეცვლები. ყველა შეცვლილ მოთამაშეს უფლება აქვს დაბრუნდეს მოედანზე.

კალათბურთს ხელით თამაშობენ. დაშვებულია ბურთის ხელით ტარება, გადაცემა და ტყორცნა, როგორც ცალი, ასევე ორი ხელით. არ შეიძლება ორ ნაბიჯზე მეტის გადადგმა ბურთის დაუგდებლად, ბურთიანად ახტომა და დახტომა, მეტოქის საჯარიმო ზონაში სამ წამზე მეტხანს ყოფნა. გუნდს ბურთის მეტოქის ნახევარზე გადატანისათვის ეძლევა 8, ხოლო შეტევისათვის სულ — 24 წამი, რომლის გასვლის შემდეგ ბურთი მეტოქეს გადაეცემა. მწვრთნელს უფლება აქვს თითოეულ ტაიმში აიღოს ერთი წუთშესვენება (მეოთხეში — ორი). მოთამაშე ჯარიმდება ყველა ამ წესის დარღვევისათვის, აგრეთვე ბლოკირებისათვის და უხეში თამაშისათვის. მოთამაშე ჯარიმდება როგორც ჩვეულებრივი ჯარიმით, ასევე პერსონალური შენიშვნით. 5 პერსონალური შენიშვნის მიღების შემთხვევაში მოთამაშე ტოვებს მოედანს. ოთხი გუნდური შენიშვნის შემდეგ ყოველი ჯარიმა სრულდება საჯარიმო ტყორცნებით. ჩაგდებული საჯარიმო იძლევა 1 ქულას. თამაშის მსვლელობისას 2-ქულიან ზონიდან ჩაგდებული ბურთი ფასდება 2, ხოლო 3-ქულიანი ზონიდან ჩაგდებული - სამ ქულად.

საერთაშორისო ფედერაცია
მთავარი სტატია: კალათბურთის საერთაშორისო ფედერაცია.
კალათბურთის საერთაშორისო ფედერაცია (Federation Internationale de Basketball - FIBA) დაარსდა 1932 წლის ივნისს ქალაქ ჟენევაში. დამფუძნებელი ქვეყნები იყვნენ: არგენტინა, იტალია, ლატვია, პორტუგალია, რუმინეთი, საბერძნეთი, შვეიცარია და ჩეხოსლოვაკია. ამჟამად იგი აერთიანებს 212 ქვეყანას და 5 ზონალურ (კონტინენტალურ) კომისიას.

მნიშვნელოვანი ტურნირები
კალათბურთში, ისევე როგორც სპორტის ბევრ სხვა სახეობაში უმთავრესი ტურნირია ოლიმპიური თამაშების პროგრამით გათვალისწინებული კალათბურთელთა ტურნირი, რომელსაც კალათბურთის საერთაშორისო ფედერაცია საერთაშორისო ოლიმპიურ კომიტეტთან ერთად ატარებს. ასევე უმნიშვნელოვანესი ტურნირია მსოფლიოს ჩემპიონატი ვაჟთა და ქალთა შორის.

გარდა ამისა ზონალური (კონტინენტალური) კომისიები ატარებენ თავიანთი კონტინენტების ჩემპიონატებს და საკლუბო ტურნირებს.

მეტად პოპულარულია ტურნირი, რომელსაც ატარებს ნაციონალური საკალათბურთო ასოციაცია — NBA, რომელიც საკლუბო დონეზე იმართება ამერიკულ და კანადურ კლუბებს შორის.</p>
